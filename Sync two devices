You'll need to have *BOTH* USRPs in a single, multi-channel block, with 
one of them set to use MIMO for reference clock and time synch, and
   the other "internal".

Each device should have its own IP address on the same subnet, which 
will cause it to use MIMO for the sample-data as well, in
   "shared ethernet" mode.

uhd_rx_cfile allows to record from multiple channels (see the -c option).
